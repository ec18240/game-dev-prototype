NOTE: 
- The mummy contains bugs so we are using a sphere to demonstrate the gameplay. The full game will include a working mummy!

- Activate the point multiplier to get extra points but collecting a streak of points in the space of a few seconds

- Hope you enjoy, tell us your fastest time
- My fastest time was 35.9 seconds and my highest score was 61,800 (Ashley)

- IMPORTANT NOTE: if you want to test the mummy player (which is still under development) please deactivate the Player1A, activate the freelook camera and activate mummy player [vice versa for the ball player] . thank you.

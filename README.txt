- Arrow keys/WASD keys to move
- Space-bar to jump
- Press A to interact with doors and yellow squares
- Shift button to shape-shift and go under surfaces.

OBJECTIVES:

1. Collect all the yellow rubies to proceed further (You can jump but this is cheating during the prototype! Unless you're speed-running)

2. When you cross the bridge and make it to the second area, press shift to go under the surfaces. Press A on the yellow block

3. Jump up the blocks and complete the puzzle *wink*

4. Dodge the enemies

5. Duck under the RED surface with the shift button

6. Go to the second door and open it. Collect the power-up and go near points. See what it does *another wink*

7. Stroll to the finishing line!

NOTE: 
- The mummy contains bugs so we are using a sphere to demonstrate the gameplay. The full game will include a working mummy!

- Activate the point multiplier to get extra points but collecting a streak of points in the space of a few seconds

- Hope you enjoy, tell us your fastest time
- My fastest time was 32.9 seconds and my highest score was 108,800 (Ashley)

- IMPORTANT NOTE: if you want to test the mummy player (which is still under development) please deactivate the Player1A, activate the freelook camera and activate mummy player [vice versa for the ball player] . thank you.

- When playing, there will be a 'preview packages in use' in the top of the screen. I don't know how to get rid of this but
- Click on it and click 'dismiss for now'

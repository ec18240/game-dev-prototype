     * method in order to increase the amount of switches on.
     * When their timer decreases, the switches are reset and they call the off switch
     * method to notify the script that they are off
     * 
     * When all the switches are on as in, when the number of children (switches)
     * is equal to the amount of switches on, the door activates and the player can proceed

     * 
     * When writing this script, the idea was, there'd be points along a path which the
     * player moves towards. The path is based on the rampPathArray.
     * Each point is a sphere in an invisible camera layer that I added (so you can't see the spheres in-game)
     * 
     * The player will move towards each sphere in the index of the array. This script simulates a 
     * quick-time scripted event so the player does not have control of the mummy until the event is done
